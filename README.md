# Student-management-system-java
“This is a simple Student Management System developed using Java.
The main purpose of this project is to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

The system allows users to add, search, delete, and display student records.
It also supports different student types such as local and foreign students using inheritance.

I used an interface to define a common display behavior and polymorphism to handle different student objects in a flexible way.
Student data can be saved to a text file using basic file handling.

Overall, this project helped me understand how to design a small but well-structured OOP-based system.”
